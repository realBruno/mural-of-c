# Mural
This repository contains every project I made in C.

# A little background

I have been in touch with programming since my first semester in college, where I took Intro to Programming Logic with Python. For personal reasons, during the first two semesters I barely had the opportunity to learn much about coding. I only had access to my computer on weekends, and even then I would mostly spend my time learning maths.

Finally, at the end of this year, things changed and I am now able to focus more in coding. In college I still pretty much only see maths, but I have been self-teaching myself C since november.

I started out with Python, in october, for it is an easier language to grasp and most jobs opportunities are oriented to Python or JavaScript. I had a great time with it. Then, I gave C a try and now it is the language that I am most passionate about learning.

The objective behind this repository is to exhibit every project that I made so far in C, and see how much progress I've made/will make as time passes.

# Projects

The projects are listed below, ordered by start date and followed by a little description. Those with a marked checkbox have already been finished.

Some of the repositories are in Brazilian Portuguese, these have Brazil's flag by their side. Some other repositories are private, because most of the project is still to be done, these are sinalized with üõ†Ô∏è.
