# Mural
This repository contains every project I made in C.

# A little background

I have been in touch with programming since my first semester in college, where I took Intro to Programming Logic with Python. For personal reasons, during the first two semesters I barely had the opportunity to learn much about coding. I only had access to my computer on weekends, and I even then I would mostly spend my time learning maths.

Finally, at the end of this year, things changed and I am now able to focus more in coding. In college I still pretty much only see maths, but I have been self-teaching myself C since november.

I started out with Python, in october, for it is an easier language to grasp and most jobs opportunities point to Python or JavaScript. I had a great time with it. Then, I gave C a try and now it is the language that I am most passionate about learning.

The objective behind this repository is to exhibit of all the projects that I made so far with it, and see how much progress I've made/will make as time passes.

    * Project from the residency program "EmbarcaTech". The project was originally group-oriented, but after doing my part on the group, I took some time out to do everything by myself for personal improvement. It converts multiple units, such as-but not limiting to-temperature, mass, and volume.
